    "## Why Hodgkin–Huxley and Bayesian Inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces how we can use **Bayesian inference** to estimate parameters in a **Hodgkin–Huxley (HH)** neuron model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HH model describes how neurons generate electrical impulses (action potentials) using ion channels. These equations are biologically detailed and nonlinear, meaning that **small changes in parameters** (like resting potential or stimulus amplitude) can produce **very different voltage traces**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in real experiments, we rarely know the exact parameter values — we only observe the **voltage recordings**. So, we turn to **Bayesian inference** to estimate the *probable values* of hidden parameters given the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use **simulation-based inference (SBI)**, which lets us:\n",
    "- Simulate artificial (“synthetic”) data from our model,\n",
    "- Train a neural network to approximate the posterior distribution \\( p(\\theta | x) \\),\n",
    "- And then infer parameters for new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is especially useful when:\n",
    "- The model is **complex or non-linear**,\n",
    "- The **likelihood function** is hard to write down analytically,\n",
    "- But we can easily **simulate** data from the model.\n",

    "## Scalability Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Current Performance\n",
    "- Each HH simulation takes ~ 0.0929 ± 0.0015 seconds\n",
    "- Generating 500 training examples takes ~ 46.43 seconds (0.77 minutes)\n",
    "- Once trained, inference is very fast (~ 0.01 ms per sample)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scaling to Larger Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "**More complex models** (e.g., multi-compartment neurons, network models):\n",
    "- Simulation time increases linearly with model complexity\n",
    "- May need more training data (1000-10000 simulations)\n",
    "- Could take hours to generate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential optimizations**:\n",
    "1. **Parallel simulations**: Run multiple simulations simultaneously\n",
    "2. **GPU acceleration**: Use CUDA-enabled simulators (e.g., Brian2CUDA)\n",
    "3. **Active learning**: Intelligently choose which parameters to simulate\n",
    "4. **Amortized inference**: Train once, infer for many observations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison with Traditional Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)**:\n",
    "- Would require evaluating likelihood for each proposed parameter\n",
    "- Since HH likelihood is intractable, would need likelihood-free MCMC (very slow)\n",
    "- Current approach: train once, then fast inference for any new observation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization-based methods** (e.g., genetic algorithms):\n",
    "- Need many forward simulations per observation\n",
    "- Current approach: after training, inference is essentially free\n"
