    "## Why Hodgkin–Huxley and Bayesian Inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces how we can use **Bayesian inference** to estimate parameters in a **Hodgkin–Huxley (HH)** neuron model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HH model describes how neurons generate electrical impulses (action potentials) using ion channels. These equations are biologically detailed and nonlinear, meaning that **small changes in parameters** (like resting potential or stimulus amplitude) can produce **very different voltage traces**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in real experiments, we rarely know the exact parameter values — we only observe the **voltage recordings**. So, we turn to **Bayesian inference** to estimate the *probable values* of hidden parameters given the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use **simulation-based inference (SBI)**, which lets us:\n",
    "- Simulate artificial (“synthetic”) data from our model,\n",
    "- Train a neural network to approximate the posterior distribution \\( p(\\theta | x) \\),\n",
    "- And then infer parameters for new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is especially useful when:\n",
    "- The model is **complex or non-linear**,\n",
    "- The **likelihood function** is hard to write down analytically,\n",
    "- But we can easily **simulate** data from the model.\n",
